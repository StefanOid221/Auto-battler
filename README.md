# Auto_battler

This is my final degree project, an auto battler. It is open to improvements and many things could be redesigned, but the intention was to setup a base for developing any kind of auto battler project.
It includes the main mechanics of auto battler games and also a trained AI to play against. The training was performed using Reinforcement learning and the ML-Agents Unity toolkit. It was my first time
using machine learning techniques, and maybe it is not the best trained AI, but as a begining is good.

Feel free to use this project as you want.
